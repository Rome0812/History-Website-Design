                    <h2>Sergio Osmeña</h2>
                    <p>
                    Sergio Osmeña, a Filipino leader, was born on September 9, 1878, in Cebu City, Philippines, and passed away on October 19, 1961, in Manila. He founded the Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista) and served as president of the Philippines from 1944 to 1946.
                    In 1903, Osmeña graduated with a law degree from the University of Santo Tomás in Manila. In addition, he edited El Nuevo Día, a Spanish newspaper published in Cebu City. He was named governor of the province of Cebu and fiscal (district attorney) for the provinces of Cebu and Negros Oriental by the American colonial authority in 1904. He was chosen to serve as governor of Cebu two years later. He established the Nationalist Party, which eventually came to control Philippine politics, after being chosen as a delegate to the Philippine National Assembly in 1907.

                    <p>
                    Lapu-Lapu (1491–1542) was praised as one of the Philippines' greatest heroes. One of the first things that come to mind for Filipinos when they hear the name Lapu-lapu is the Filipinos' successful struggle against the foreigners under Ferdinand Magellan during the Battle of Mactan. The fact that Lapu-lapu was the only village head to defy foreign authority—while the leader of the nearby islands, Raja Humabon of the island of Cebu, had already acknowledged the Spanish king as their sovereign—was what really set him apart

                    <h2>Juan F. Nakpil</h2>
                    <p>
                    A pioneer and innovator in Philippine architecture, Juan F. Nakpil is also a teacher, civic leader, and architect. Nakpil's most significant contribution is essentially his advocacy for building that is representative of Philippine customs and culture and his conviction that there is such a thing as Philippine architecture. His ardent advocacy and endeavors have also played a significant role in granting private Filipino architects and engineers legal access to engage in the planning and implementation of government projects. In the structures that now serve as the nation's architectural legacy, he has skillfully combined strength, use, and beauty. In addition to rebuilding and expanding the Quiapo Church in 1930 and adding a second belfry and a dome to the original design, he also designed the altar for the 1937 International Eucharistic Congress.
                    Nakpil is known for his major works such as the University of the Philippines Administration and University Library, the reconstructed Rizal house in Calamba, Laguna, the Geronimo de los Reyes Building, the Magsaysay Building, the Rizal Theater, the Capitol Theater, the Captain Pepe Building, the Manila Jockey Club, the Rufino Building, and the Philippine Village Hotel.

                    <p>
                    On October 24, 1927, Marcelo Briones Fernan was born in Cebu City.  He had nine children with Eloisa Nolasco, his spouse, after they were married.
                    Fernan excelled as a scholar and youth leader while attending school.  In addition to being elected to the International Honor Societies of Pi Gamma Mu and Phi Kappa, he presided over the Student Council Association of the Philippines as its president. In 1952, he graduated from the University of the Philippines' College of Law in the top ten percent of his class.  He graduated with a master's degree in law from Harvard University in the United States the following year.
                    In addition, he had a busy social and civic life as president of the Cebu Newspaper Workers Foundation, Inc., chairman of the Cebu Jaycees Role Club of Cebu West, and president of the Cebu Country Club.

                    <h2>Leandro V. Locsin</h2>
                    <p>
                    Filipino architect, artist, and interior designer Leandro V. Locsin was renowned for his use of concrete, floating volumes, and straightforward design in a variety of his work. The late former President Corazon C. Aquino named him a National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture in 1990.
                    Leandro V. Locsin, the grandson of the province's first governor, was born in Silay City, Negros Occidental, on August 15, 1928. After the Second World War, he returned to Negros and attended the De La Salle Brothers in 1935. After moving back to Manila, he studied pre-law at the University of Santo Tomas before deciding to pursue a bachelor's degree in music. A year or so before he graduated, despite his talent as a pianist, he changed his major once more to architecture. He had two children, one of whom is also an architect, from his marriage to Cecilia Yulo.
