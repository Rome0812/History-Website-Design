                    <p>
                        Mayon also known as Mount Mayon and Mayon Volcano is an active stratovolcano in the province of Albay in Bicol, Philippines. 
                        A popular tourist spot, it is renowned for its "perfect cone" because of its symmetric conical shape, 
                        and is regarded as sacred in Philippine mythology. 
                        The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. 
                        It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000. It is the centerpiece of the Albay Biosphere Reserve, declared by UNESCO in 2016, and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site. 
                        Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines, and its activity is regularly monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) from their provincial headquarters on Lig√±on Hill, about 12 kilometers (7.5 mi) from the summit.

                    <h2>Rice Terraces</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors of the Igorot people. 
                        The terraces are occasionally called the "Eighth Wonder of the World". It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) above sea level. 
                        These are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half of the globe. Locals up to this day still plant rice and vegetables on the terraces, 
                        although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the terraces. The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic "steps", which require constant reconstruction and care. 
                        In 2010, a further problem encountered was drought, with the terraces drying up completely in March of that year. Anthropologist Otley Beyer has estimated that the terraces are over 2000 years old, but several researchers dispute this and contend that they were built much later. 
                        Nevertheless, rice is an ancient ancestral crop of the Philippines, having been carried by Austronesian migrations into the islands since at least 1500 BCE (3500 years ago).

                        Intramuros, often referred to as the "Walled City," is a historic district in Manila, Philippines. Established in the late 16th century by Spanish colonizers, it served as the political and military hub during the Spanish colonial period.
                        Intramuros is characterized by its massive stone walls, fortifications, and well-preserved Spanish colonial architecture. Notable landmarks include Fort Santiago, Manila Cathedral, and San Agustin Church, a UNESCO World Heritage site. 
                        The district's cobblestone streets, plazas, and museums provide a rich historical experience, reflecting centuries of Filipino culture and heritage. Today, Intramuros is a vibrant cultural and tourist destination,
