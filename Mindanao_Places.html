                    <h2>Mount Apo</h2>
                    <p>
                    (Davao del Sur and North Cotabato) The highest point in the Philippines, Mount Apo, is an active volcano located in south central Mindanao, 20 miles (32 km) west of Davao City. It rises to a height of 9,692 feet (2,954 meters). Situated in the Cordillera Central, it is encircled by towering tropical hardwood forests; its height is almost exactly matched by two minor summits. 199,819 acres (80,864 hectares) make up Mount Apo National Park, which was created in 1936. It is home to the endangered Philippine eagle and boasts a variety of peaks and valleys, as well as Malasita Falls, Sibulao Lake, and the Kisinte Hot Springs.

                    <h2>Camiguin Island</h2>
                    <p>
                    The native term "Kamagong," which refers to a species of ebony tree, is whence the name Camiguin originates.
                    on 1521 and 1565, respectively, explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Miguel Lopez de Legaspi made landfalls on Camiguin. In 1598, the first Spanish village was founded in the present-day Guinsiliban. There is an old Spanish watchtower in Guinsiliban, which derives from the Kinamiguin phrase "Ginsil-ipan," which means "to look out for pirates from a watchtower." Here, the Camiguinons kept watch for Moro pirates.
                    The Katagman or Katadman (also known as Catarman) was the name of the first significant Spanish settlement, founded in 1679. The town expanded and thrived until the eruption of Mount Vulcan in 1871 completely destroyed it. What is currently Barangay Bonbon in Catarman is the former location.

                    <h2>Siargao Island</h2>
                    <p>
                    On Mindanao's northeastern shore sits the teardrop-shaped island of Siargao. It is most renowned for its consistent year-round surfing conditions, which have made it the "Surfing Capital of the Philippines." Because of its consistent surfing weather, it is now a fantastic place for both experienced and novice surfers.
                    Of all its surfing locations, Cloud 9 is regarded as the most well-liked. Its right-hand waves that break over a reef and its thick, hollow tubes have also made it famous throughout the world.
                    Siargao Island is known for its surfing spots, but it also has white sand beaches, gorgeous islands, blue waters that are excellent for diving and snorkeling, waterfalls, lagoons, and caverns.

                    <h2>Lake Sebu</h2>
                    <p>
                    Nestled in the highlands of South Cotabato, Mindanao is a serene sanctuary known as Lake Sebu. It is also among the Philippines' most exquisite lakes. In addition to being well known for its breathtaking surroundings, the lake provides the residents with a means of subsistence. A section of the lake has been turned into an aquaculture plant, with regular tilapia farming and growth taking place. In the meantime, the adjacent lands are ideal for farming and are employed to cultivate a range of crops throughout the year.

                    <h2>Enchanted River</h2>
                    <p>
                    (Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur) A little section of river, HIDDEN IN THE PHILIPPINE JUNGLE, appears to emerge from the earth and flow into the sea with remarkably clear, blue water.
                    A perfect saltwater river that empties into the Pacific Ocean is the Hinatuan Enchanted River in Mindanao, Philippines. Though it is just slightly longer than a river and only about 80 feet deep, the flow draws tourists from all over the world who come to see the stunning waters that the locals have long believed to be supernatural. Its nickname, "Enchanted River," originated from a Modesto Farolan poem.
