His life outside the ring added to the incredible story of his ascent from extreme poverty to the top of his sport. In the Philippines, where he achieved unparalleled popularity through commercial endorsements, movies, television series, CDs, and his image on a postage stamp, the charismatic "Pac-Man" served as both an idol and a unifying force.
