                    <div class="des">In the southern Philippines, the Sultanate of Sulu was a Muslim state that governed over a large number of the Sulu Sea islands. Genealogical records establish the Sultanate of Sulu's founding around 1457, despite the belief of Muslim historians that it existed centuries earlier, during the reign of Raja Baguinda Ali. The market for Sulu's maritime and forest products increased during the seventeenth century as a result of increased Western trade activity in China, and Sulu continued to have a stable tribute relationship with China throughout the eighteenth century. </div>

                    In the Philippines, indigenous cultural communities, or ICCs, are thought to comprise roughly 10% of the total population. Known by another name, "cultural minorities," they had been driven into the mountains and forests ever since lowlanders had established towns and cities. Due to widespread discrimination, the majority of ICC members lack private property and money, making it difficult for them to assimilate into society. The ICC fight to preserve their native territory and cultural identity in the face of forest degradation and the lowland majority's attempts to integrate them into Christian culture.
                    To set themselves apart from the local Christians and Muslims, fifteen of the more than eighteen indigenous communities (ICC) in Mindanao adopted the term lumad, which is the Bisayan word for "native" or "indigenous," in 1986. During Corazon Aquino's administration, Republic Act 6734 was passed, and it used this word to set these ethnic groupings apart from the Bangsamoro people.

                    After Fr. arrived, on June 23, 1635, work on building Fort Pilar began. In Zamboanga were Captain Juan de Chaves, Melchor de Vera, a Jesuit missionary engineer, 1,000 Visayans, and 300 Spaniards.
                    De Vera's masterwork, Fort Pilar, was reconstructed in 1718 after being abandoned in 1663. It acted as a barrier against Moros, Dutch, Portuguese, and British attacks for centuries. After World War II, it fell into ruin; the National Museum of the Philippines brought it back to its former splendor.

                    Moro Wars, (1901–13), in Philippine history, a series of scattered campaigns involving American troops and Muslim bands on Mindanao, Philippines. The Moro fought for religious rather than political reasons, and their actions were unconnected with those of the Filipino revolutionaries who conducted the Philippine-American War (1899–1902).
                    When sovereignty over the Philippines passed to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, the United States initiated a policy designed to assimilate the Moro into the Philippine nation and to curb some feudal practices such as slave trading. The result of this attempt to alter the traditional ways of the Moro was intransigence and rebellion.

                    In the "battle of Marawi," which took place between May and October of this year between the Philippine military and militants affiliated with the armed group going by the name Islamic State (IS), civilians on the island of Mindanao paid a heavy price, with dozens of casualties and extensive property and home destruction, according to a report released by Amnesty International today.
                    Based on a September research trip to Lanao del Sur, Mindanao, "Battle of Marawi: Death and destruction in the Philippines" is the first comprehensive human rights analysis of the conflict. It details the worst atrocities committed by militants aligned with IS against Christian populations, including at least 25 extrajudicial executions, widespread kidnapping, and massive theft of private property.
