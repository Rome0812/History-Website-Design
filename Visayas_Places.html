                    <h2>Bohol Cholocalate Hills</h2>
                    <p>
                    The terrain of the Chocolate Hills and the area around them is primarily flat to undulating, with elevations ranging from 100 to 500 meters above sea level. On June 18, 1988, it was designated as the third National Geological Monument in the nation in honor of its significance to science and distinctive geomorphology.
                    The conical, nearly symmetrical, and identically proportioned hills known as the "Chocolate Hills" are more artistically expansive than the formations found in Java. These were caused by erosion and rainfall, and they represented the uplift of coral deposits. The hills are made up of roughly 1,776 mounds with a similar overall shape and are dispersed among the cities of Carmen, Batuan, and Sagbayan. The grass-covered hills take on a chocolate brown hue during the dry season when precipitation is insufficient; this is how the name for a branded delicacy originated.

                    <h2>Boracay Island</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Philippines' tropical island of Boracay is reachable by plane from Metro Manila in about one hour.

In the 2020 Readers' Choice Awards of Condé Nast Traveler's 25 Best Island Beaches in the World, White Beach, Boracay came in second.

                    <h2>Kawasan Falls</h2>
                    <p>
                    Barangay Matutinao in the town of Badian, Cebu is home to the multi-layered waterfall system known as Kawasan Falls. It is without a doubt the most popular destination for tourists in Badian.
                    At the base of the Mantalongon Mountain Range, Kawasan Falls is renowned for its stunning turquoise water. It is situated around one kilometer from the Badian national road and requires at least four hours of walking from Osmeña Peak in Dalaguete. Its crystal-clear, cold water flows from Kandayvic Spring through layers of waterfalls and into the Matutinao River, then into the Tañon Strait.

                    <h2>Magellan Cross</h2>
                    <p>
                    One of Cebu City's most well-known historical sites is Magellan's Cross. The cross is frequently visited by a large number of tourists and is housed in an octagonal pavilion composed of red tiles and adobe. It is close to the Basilica Minore Del Sto, in front of Cebu City Hall. Magellan is honored with the name Nino at Magallanes Street.
                    Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan, who served as the King of Spain's deputy, and his crew landed at Cebu on March 15, 1521. He immediately made friends with Rajah Humabon, the Cebu leader at the time. Humabon, his wife Queen Juana, and his aboriginal people were converted to Christianity by Magellan, who also had them baptized as Christians.

                    <h2>SanJuanico Bridge</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Pan Philippine Highway, which runs from Tacloban to Santa Rita, Samar, crosses the San Juanico Bridge, which links the islands of Leyte and Samar. It was regarded as the longest bridge in the Philippines at 2.6 kilometers until the new Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX) opened to traffic on April 27, 2022. Views of the San Juanico Strait, with its whirlpools and islets strewn across it, are picturesque when one crosses the bridge. It travels to Tacloban City (Leyte) and Santa Rita City (Santa Rita) (Samar) and has two lanes.
