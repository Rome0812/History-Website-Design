                    <div class="des">The 38th Kadayawan Festival is underway this year, which means that in addition to the usual heavy traffic, the streets of Davao City are now brimming with smiling residents and visitors.
                        Since Kadayawan emphasizes the abundant harvest for Davao City's residents, particularly the Lumad, Moro, and Christians, it has grown in popularity.
                        The festival's beginnings are connected to the Lumad of Kidapawan, North Cotabato province, according to a column by Muss Lidasan.
                        Through the Mindanao Highlanders Association (Mindahila), the indigenous peoples of Cotabato started commemorating the Kalibongan Festival back in the 1970s, promoting harmony among the
                        native peoples. The group from Kidapawan asked to have the tribal meeting in Davao City.</div>

                        In May, the province also holds its annual Sarangani Bay Festival, which takes place in the summer.

                    <div class="des"> The Philippines' provinces each celebrate their culture in a distinctive way. For instance, the T'nalak Festival is a significant annual event held in the province of South Cotabato. The festival is a week-long celebration that takes place in South Cotabato's main city of Koronadal City every July.
                    The vibrant abaca fabric known as "t'nalak," which is produced by women from the T'boli tribe in South Cotabato, is the source of the festival's name. The cloth's design is original and was "dreamed up" by the maker. The T'nalak cloth serves as the festival icon because it symbolizes the blending of the cultures, power, and unity of the numerous ethnic groups living in the province; this is why the province is called as "The Land of the Dreamweavers."

                    <div class="title">Kaamulan Festival</div>
                    <div class="des"> "Kaamulan" originates from the Binukid verb "amul," signifying "to gather." There is a reason why the tribespeople from Bukidnon are assembling. It can refer to a marriage ceremony, a datuship rite, a peace treaty, a thanksgiving celebration during harvest season, or any combination of these.
                    Every year, the Kaamulan, which highlights Bukidnon's distinct indigenous culture, takes place in the province, especially in Malaybalay City, the provincial capital, from the second half of February to March 10. The latter date commemorates the region's founding as a province in 1917.

                    <div class="des"> Maguindanao, Maranao, and Iranun dance the Sagayan, a war dance from the Philippines that dramatically portrays the steps their hero, Prince Bantugan, took while donning his weapons, the battle he participated in, and his eventual victory. Performers portraying fierce warriors would attempt rolling motions to defend their master while holding a kampilan sword in one hand and shields with shell noisemakers in the other.
                    The Sagayan dancers' outfits are modeled in descriptions of Bantugan's tools found in the epic Darangen. According to the description, he was dressed in rainbow-colored clothing, a klong (shield) adorned with tiny bells and made of the hardest wood, a large, double-tipped war sword called a kampilan, which was tied to his wrist with five or seven animal hair-decorated holes, and a shorter secondary sword called a magerag. The brilliantly colored kapasti, adorned with feathers, mirrors, and tassels, is commonly mistaken for a sayap, a traditional conical headdress, among the Maguindanao people. The outfit is seen as a red, green, and yellow three-tiered skirt.
