                    <div class="title">Ferdinand Magellan's Arrival (1521)</div>                  
                    <div class="des">On March 16, 1521, at dawn, precisely 501 years ago, Spain caught sight of the region that would soon be named for its monarch, Philip the Prudent: the Philippines.
                    The Portuguese adventurer Ferdinand Magellan and his crew saw the island of Zamal, now known as Samar, shimmering in their eyes, like optimism on the horizon. Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian nobleman, accompanied them and documented the Spanish expedition that departed from Seville on August 10, 1519, heading west for the Moluccas.
                    After a bad experience at Islas de Ladrones, or "islands of thieves," which are now the Marianas Islands, where the locals, according to Pigafetta's journal, "entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on," they were terrified when they first saw Zamal. "The captain-general (Magellan) in wrath went ashore with 40 armed men, who burned around 40 or 50 houses together with many boats, and killed seven men," Pigafetta wrote.

                    <div class="title">The Arrival of Christianity in the Philippines</div>
                    <div class="des">
                    The Philippines' Christian history began in 1521, when Ferdinand Magellan landed on the island of Cebu shortly before Easter. Despite being Portuguese, Magellan was traveling on a voyage that had started in Spain two years prior, representing the Spanish monarch. Magellan's purpose was to sail west and discover a different way to the Spice Islands. A little chain of islands known as the Spice Islands lay southeast of the Philippines and northeast of Indonesia. They were renowned for being the world's biggest producers of pepper, cloves, mace, and nutmeg. The Spice Islands are referred to as the Moluccas on modern maps.
                    For centuries before to the arrival of European ships in the Far East, there was a flourishing commerce in spices and other items. African ivory, Indian cottons, Chinese silks, and Arabian coffee were used to purchase spices. These spices were available in Europe, but because they had to be transported by land through numerous traders, the costs were quite exorbitant. Every trader gained money, and by the time the spices reached Europe, their initial cost in the Spice Islands may have been multiplied by a thousand. The Portuguese and Spanish considered their world excursions as essentially business endeavors, looking for methods to boost supply and drive down prices for commodities like spices. However, these two civilizations also felt a religious need to travel across oceans.
                    At first, Magellan appeared to be successful in completing his two missions: trade and preaching. Humabon, the first native chief Jesus encountered, accepted Christ after hearing the gospel. It is said that Humabon's grandson had an incurable fever for a number of years, but that the fever disappeared within days of his baptism. The inhabitants of Humabon were more receptive to the Gospel as word of this miracle spread. Ultimately, more than two thousand people from the nearby towns of Cebu, which is directly south of me, became Christians.

                    Prior to Spanish colonialism, on April 27, 1521, the Battle of Mactan (Cebuano: Gubat sa Mactan; Filipino: Labanan sa Mactan; Spanish: Batalla de Mactán) took place in the Philippines. A Spanish force battling for Rajah Humabon of Cebu was routed and beaten by the warriors of Lapu-Lapu, a native leader of Mactan Island. Ferdinand Magellan, who lost his life in the conflict, led the Spanish force.

                    The brief conflict over control of the Visayan islands group (10–20 April 1942) pitted Japanese forces against US and Filipino forces was known as the "Battle of the Visayan Islands."
                    Together with Mindanao and Luzon, the Visayan islands group is one of the three main geographical divisions of the Philippine islands group. Situated in the middle of the archipelago, it is made up of a number of islands that encircle the Visayan Sea, yet the Visayan islands group is also thought to be the northernmost point of the Sulu Sea. The region may also be considered to include the provinces of Palawan, Romblon, and Masbate, whose populations identify as Visayans and whose languages are more closely related to other Visayan languages than to the major languages of Luzon. The major islands in the group are Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, and Samar.

                    <div class="des">
                    The longest known insurrection in Philippine history is the Dagohoy rebellion, often referred to as the Dagohoy revolution or the Dagohoy revolt. The Bohol Rebellion, led by Francisco Dagohoy, sometimes known as Francisco Sendrijas, lasted around eighty-five years on the island from 1744 to 1829.
                    It was one of two major uprisings that took place in Bohol in the Spanish era. The other was the Tamblot insurrection (1621), which was essentially a theological dispute and was led by Tamblot, a babaylan or native priest from Bohol.
