                    <h2>José Rizal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jose Rizal, born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, is celebrated as the national hero of the Philippines. 
                        A polymath and intellectual, Rizal was a prolific writer, physician, and reformist. He is best known for his novels "Noli Me Tangere"
                        and "El Filibusterismo," which exposed the injustices and abuses of the Spanish colonial regime and galvanized the 
                        Filipino nationalist movement. His advocacy for peaceful reform, education, and civil rights made him a pivotal figure in the 
                        Philippine revolution against Spanish rule. Despite his commitment to non-violence, Rizal was arrested, tried for sedition, 
                        and executed on December 30, 1896. His martyrdom ignited widespread resistance and significantly contributed to the country's eventual independence. 
                        Today, Rizal's legacy endures, symbolizing patriotism, enlightenment, and the relentless pursuit of freedom.

                    <h2>Andrés Bonifacio</h2>
                    <p>
                        Andres Bonifacio, born on November 30, 1863, in Tondo, Manila, is a revered Filipino revolutionary and one of the foremost leaders in the struggle for 
                        Philippine independence from Spanish colonial rule. Known as the "Father of the Philippine Revolution," Bonifacio founded and led the Katipunan,
                        a secret society that sought independence through armed revolt. Unlike the reformist approach of his contemporary, Jose Rizal, 
                        Bonifacio believed that freedom could only be achieved through direct action and revolution. His leadership was instrumental in the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, 
                        marking the beginning of the end for Spanish rule in the Philippines. Despite his significant contributions, Bonifacio's life ended tragically; he was executed by fellow revolutionaries in 1897 amid internal conflicts. 
                        Today, Bonifacio is honored as a national hero, symbolizing courage, patriotism, and the fight for independence.

                    <h2>Manuel L. Quezon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Was born in Baler, Tayabas (now Quezon) Province in 1878, was a key figure in the Philippines' path to independence. Serving as the first President of the Philippine Commonwealth from 1935 to 1944, 
                        Quezon advocated strongly for Filipino nationalism and autonomy. His presidency saw the establishment of institutions like the National Language Institute and the enactment of laws leading to eventual independence. 
                        Quezon's leadership was tested during World War II, where he continued to fight for Philippine sovereignty, eventually establishing a government-in-exile. Despite his death in 1944, his legacy as a champion of independence 
                        and Filipino identity remains deeply ingrained in Philippine history.

                    <h2>Emilio Aguinaldo</h2>
                    <p>
                        Was born on March 22, 1869, in Cavite El Viejo (now Kawit), Cavite, was a Filipino revolutionary leader and the first President of the Philippines. He played a crucial role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule and later in the Philippine-American War. 
                        Aguinaldo became the leader of the revolutionary forces and proclaimed Philippine independence on June 12, 1898, in Kawit, Cavite, establishing the First Philippine Republic. However, the Philippines was soon annexed by the United States, leading to the Philippine-American War. 
                        Aguinaldo was captured by American forces in 1901, effectively ending the war. Despite this, he continued to be involved in Filipino politics and later collaborated with the Japanese during their occupation of the Philippines during World War II. Aguinaldo's legacy is complex, 
                        as he is both celebrated for his role in the fight for Philippine independence and criticized for his actions during the Philippine-American War and collaboration with the Japanese.
