                    <div class="des">The people and rebels of the Philippines and the Spanish colonial authority of the Spanish East Indies, under the Spanish Empire, fought each other in the Philippine Revolution, also known by the Spanish as the Tagalog War.
                        August 1896 marked the start of the Philippine Revolution when the Spanish authorities found the Katipunan, a clandestine anti-colonial group. Andrés Bonifacio's Katipunan started to have an impact on a large portion of the Philippines. The Katipunan leaders publicly announced a statewide armed revolution, formed a revolutionary government, and called it "Haring Bayang Katagalugan" during a large-scale meeting in Caloocan. Bonifacio demanded an assault on Manila, the nation's capital. Although this attack was unsuccessful, uprisings started in the neighboring regions. Specifically, early key successes were gained by rebels in Caviteunder the leadership of Mariano Álvarez and Baldomero Aguinaldo. The Katipunan leadership split as a result of a power struggle among the revolutionaries, and Bonifacio was executed in 1897. Emilio Aguinaldo, the leader of the recently established revolutionary government, now held the position of leadership.

                        After the previous owner was unable to locate a private buyer, the National Museum of the Philippines acquired the Laguna Copperplate, a thin sliver of blackened metal, in 1990.
                        After further examining the plate, it was discovered to be a 20 cm square copperplate with a ten-line inscription in beautifully drawn characters on one side. The museum sent the inscription to Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma, who was stationed in the Philippines with his Filipino wife, for analysis as they were unable to decipher it themselves.
                        When Postma carefully examined the writing, she found that it pinpointed the year the copperplate was made as "Year of Sakya 822, month of Viasakha," which corresponds to April or May of the 900th year in the Gregorian calendar.
                        Prior to the text on the Laguna Copperplate being deciphered, historians nearly unanimously agreed that the history of the Philippines began in 1521 with the arrival of Magellan and chronicler Antonia Pigafetta on the archipelago. Very little history has ever been preserved in a form that would have allowed it to remain before today. Therefore, the beginning of Filipino history was moved back 600 years by the historic discovery of the Laguna Copperplate.

They were the only channel of contact between Spain and its colony of the Philippines and provided Manila's Spanish population with a means of subsistence

American naval power status was cemented and Commodore George Dewey became a national hero as a result of the overwhelming American triumph.

                        The Republic of the Philippines gained official US recognition as an independent nation on July 4, 1946. This marked the end of a lengthy process that started in 1916 with the Jones Law, which promised to recognize Philippine independence eventually, and ended in 1934 with the Philippine Independence Act, also known as the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which established a ten-year transitional period to prepare for independence. The resumption of Manuel Roxas' presidential oath signaled the Philippines' independence and did away with the requirement that its citizens swear loyalty to the US before becoming independent. From that point on, July 4th was observed annually until 1962.
